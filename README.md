Hi there, I'm **John Shull**, a **Lead Project Scientist** :rocket: at the Office of Enterprise Research and Innovation ([OERI](https://oduinnovate.org/)) formally known as the Virginia Modeling Analysis Simulation Center ([VMASC](https://vmasc.org/)üåç) and an **Adjunct Instructor** with the [Game Studies & Design Program](https://www.odu.edu/academics/programs/undergraduate/game-studies-design) :space_invader: at [ODU](https://www.odu.edu) üöÄ!  Currently, I'm getting ready to start working on research associated with leveraging existing AI/ML workflows to help support the Aquaculture industry. I am doing a lot of collaboration with the Commercial Shellfish Aquaculture Lab & Team ([CSALT](https://www.vims.edu/research/units/labgroups/csalt/)) group and we are waiting on a [SeaGrant 2025](https://vaseagrant.org/) project to start in April that will leverage [Sonic Nets, Semi-Autonomous Vessels, and computer vision](https://github.com/JShull/JShull/blob/main/NOAA_SubmissionNarrative.pdf) services to research avian deterrence strategies. The plan is to use NVidia and Game Engines to do all sorts of fun things! 
<br />
When I'm not tinkering about, I'm probably learning life lessons from my amazing significant other :heart: or perhaps I'm on XBox :video_game: playing with my core group trying to break EA physics junk üòâ under the handle, **The JohnnyFuzz**, or maybe just jamming to some [Above & Beyond](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/above-beyond/20318188), and in some circumstances hanging out with the other Fuzz's... :eyes:

- "...nothing lasts, nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect." - *Powell, Richard R. (2004). Wabi Sabi Simple. Adams Media. ISBN 1-59337-178-0*

**Unity Package Stuffs:**

The repositories below are in the public domain under a dual license and are based on years of me using Unity and coming up with my own custom libraries. They might not be helpful but they sure as hell have saved me a ton of effort! In most cases these repositories rely on the FP_Utility and a lot of them use a scriptable object pipeline that's built around a 'Data Factory' model via FP_Data.cs. They all are formatted to work directly with Unity's Package Manager (UPM) System and can be brought in using the [Git URL approach via UPM](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html).

- [FuzzPhyte Installer](https://github.com/JShull/FP_Installer) a small package that helps install other FuzzPhyte packages.
- [FuzzPhyte Utility](https://github.com/JShull/FP_Utility) a Utility package that is considered core to all FuzzPhyte code
- [FuzzPhyte EDU Utility](https://github.com/JShull/FP_Utility_EDU) an extension of Utility that has data objects related to VA state requirements and FP_Vocab
- [FuzzPhyte RecorderFace](https://github.com/JShull/FP_RecorderFace) is an iOS application that replaces the dead Face Capture Application. Captures all 52 blendshapes via direct integration and support for ARKit and uses ARFoundation. Saves all blendshapes at 60fps to a custom JSON file and syncs audio capture native to device. The editor portion of the package includes a tool to import the JSON/Sound file to sync it with a 3D face in Unity. Also allows you to easily generate/drop that content into a user selected timeline.
- [FuzzPhyte XR](https://github.com/JShull/FP_XR) a library that provides some high level abstraction for me to write generic XR code that has zero dependencies on OVR or Unity XR. You use this package by deriving classes from it which then have the references as needed by your deployment hardware. For example things like Surface Lock, Label Tags, World Check, World Item, check alignment of transforms, and a beta of a socket system (not running yet) that mimics how OVR does attachable sockets.
- [FuzzPhyte XR OVR](https://github.com/JShull/FP_XR_OVR) an extension of XR that does have dependencies on OVR. A higher level set of scripts that interact with OVR and extend OVR for other Unity Events.
- [FuzzPhyte Network](https://github.com/JShull/FP_Network) extends and utilizes Unity NetCode to provide a set of core classes that allow you to setup and network mixed devices across a shared experience. It uses the core NetworkManager and Unity Transports to manage setting up custom players by their device type. Includes prefabs for generating local clients that are VR users and mobile users who are joining via phones/tablets.
- [FuzzPhyte Event](https://github.com/JShull/FP_Event) a simple event system that utilizes a priority queue. Abstract set of classes that require an FPEVent derived data object. Other libraries use this FP_Event for misc. things as needed
- [FuzzPhyte Dialogue](https://github.com/JShull/FP_Dialogue) a simple dialogue chaining system that uses the UI, Utility, and Utilty EDU packages to combine a way to generate a sequence/list of dialogues that have text, audio, and object references. Allows for up to 4 user different prompt responses all driven by an elaborate scriptable object set of data objects. There is no graph representation but there is a way to link Dialogues to other Dialogues giving you a way to have simple graph 'logic'. Originally written for the UIToolkit but also supports World Canvas operation with standard Unity UI elements.
- [FuzzPhyte Ray](https://github.com/JShull/FP_Ray) a wrapper that sits ontop of Unity Raycast and gives you a way to easily drop in multiple different 3D and 2D rays all from the same data objects. A lot of setup but once you generate your data objects via scriptable objects super easy to modify, adjust, and utilize. A sort of 'one raycaster' to rule them all. 

**Student Stuffs:**

I constantly am working with different individuals through my work and I want to recognize a few students that I'm sure will go on to greatness!:fire:
- Ivanka who came to us via the [Fullbright graduate student program](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/fulbright-us-student-program). She just finished her masters in Lingusitics from ODU and is with us for the summer of 2025 working with the [English Language Center](https://www.odu.edu/english-language-center), [Color Vowel](https://www.colorvowel.com), and is helping our team build out Question and Answer portion of an interactive real-time VR experience for students ü•Ω‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá¶
- Jykeim was the first student I had the privilege of working with! Jykeim was working 1-off and 1-on semesters from 2019 through his graduation in 2022! He graduated with honors from the [Cyber Security Program](https://www.odu.edu/academics/programs/undergraduate/cybersecurity)! :partying_face: Jykeim now works up in the DC area doing all sorts of fun things!
- Rachel worked with me 2021 as a graduate student on the [Modeling Religious Change Project](https://mindandculture.org/projects/modeling-social-systems/modeling-religious-change/). She currently has her [Masters in Applied Linguistics](https://www.odu.edu/academics/programs/masters/applied-linguistics) and was just accepted into the Fall 2025 [PhD Linguistics program a the University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/linguistics)!
- [Jared](https://github.com/BaconStrps) started working with me in the summer of 2022, finished his associated at [TCC](https://www.tcc.edu/programs/transfer/old-dominion-university/) and finished his undergraduate degree at ODU  [Computer Engineering Program](https://www.odu.edu/academics/programs/undergraduate/computer-engineering) spring 2025. Jared is now a project scientist with us at OERI/VMASC! üéâ 
- [Nate](https://github.com/nhallen272) started working with me in the summer of 2023, he graduated from the [Cyber Security Program](https://www.odu.edu/academics/programs/undergraduate/cybersecurity) in the fall of 2023 and is currently working at ODU as a project scientist.
- [Avantika](https://github.com/AvantikaMittapally53) started working with me the summer of 2023 and she will be completing her [Masters in Computer Science](https://www.odu.edu/academics/programs/masters/computer-science) at ODU in the fall of 2023!
- [Catherine](https://github.com/catowens) worked with me in the summer of 2022 as a collaboration effort with [VIMS](https://www.vims.edu/). She is currently enrolled in the [Industrial and Interaction Design Program at Syracuse University](https://vpa.syr.edu/academics/design/programs/industrial-interaction-design-bid/) and her [2022 summer project portfolio can be found here](https://catowensdesign.myportfolio.com/vims-x-odu-vmasc-internship) :fire:
